The outer retina (OR) represents the outermost layer of the retina, where the crucial process of light detection and its conversion into electrical signals occurs. It comprises several cell types each playing a pivotal role in the normal functioning of the retina. The disruption of these cell types has been correlated with various diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Stargardt disease (SD).
Cell-cell interactions have been established to be essential for the proper function of these cells, and dysregulation in these interactions has been linked to retinal diseases. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have empowered scientists to analyze the expression levels of different genes at a cellular level.
In this study, we employed RNA-seq datasets to analyze the expression profiles of the cell types including endothelial cells, rod photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) in the OR, aiming to identify highly expressed genes in this region. These identified genes were subsequently used to retrieve Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) from publicly available databases, generating a comprehensive PPI network to elucidate the intricate interactions occurring within the OR. Through this methodology, we identified highly interacting gene products, potentially serving as promising candidates for pharmaceutical studies, thereby facilitating the identification of optimal drug targets.
Highly interactive genes were identified based on the interaction datasets which were generated  according to the  captured interactions from two well-known databases such as STRING and IntAct.In addition to that , PPIs for some the genes which were missing from the databases was captured by manual search through literature. 
By comprehensively examining the molecular landscape and protein interactions within the outer retina, this study enhances our understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing its function. These findings hold implications for future therapeutic interventions and drug development targeting retinal diseases.
